    //There are some less known, or less used by me, nuget packages that can be used:

    //Throwing exception can be expensive. Sometimes it is better to return exceptions. To obtain this use:
    //NoThrow

    //For fluently registering some json serializators if more json customization is required
    //Fluent-Json.Net

    //Package used for streaming (so async lazy loading like in youtube films). It is well known package
    //SinglarR

    //For unit tests
    //AutoFixture

    //For copying to the clickboard (see mjCommandGenerator)
    //TextCopy
