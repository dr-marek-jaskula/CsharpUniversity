# My Learning Guide

Here I will demonstrate my approach for learning. It can not be a best method for you.

First of all, make your own learning project/projects where you gather your knowledge.

Split the learning topics into three general categories:

- Learn coding from external source
  - Tutorials, articles, videos, books
- Learn by working on your own projects
  - Practice, learn on mistakes, think on architecture
- Learn programming theory
  - Understand how and why the code works, not only how to write it, learn the dotnet infrastructure, learn programming vocabulary

Then split learning process into three general categories:

- Learning that require concentration and computer
- Learning that require some focus, but no computer
- Learning that require that can be done when doing other things

## **Learning that require concentration and computer**

This part contains learning from tutorials, articles or working on your own projects. Use two monitors: one for the tutorial, article, or just google and the second one for IDE. Try to use free content, but sometimes consider buying some courses. Try to plan time for this type of learning.

## **Learning that require some focus, but no computer**

This part contains learning from tutorials, videos, books or articles when being a bit tired, traveling by a train or a bus, or waiting for something. Use tablet, phone or book. Learn about alternative approaches, good practices and conventions, solution structure, tips and tricks, advance IDE settings/plug-ins, shortcuts, application architecture, basics of cmd, important NuGet packages, programming theory.

## **Learning that can be done when doing other things**

This part contains learning from podcasts and similar videos (that does not require watching). Use phone or tablet. Learn about application design, common mistakes, advices for new developers, advices about interviews, soft skills, scrum, working in teams, alternative approaches, road paths, programming theory. Search for new sources of informations.
